- **Challenges faced**: I needed to adapt to coding React using component.js files instead of JSX files, and using global styles with variables. This presented a great opportunity for me to become familiar with writing React components in regular JavaScript syntax, along with leveraging styled components for managing global styles using variables.‚úåÔ∏è
